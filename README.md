Images are frequently dispatched in large volumes over an insecure transmission channel from exceptional sources, a few photograph statistics incorporates mystery statistics, a few pictures itself are surprisingly exclusive hence, securing them from any assault is essentially required. To remedy this crisis, we propose the usage of AES set of rules for encrypting and decrypting photographs and multimedia. This encrypted statistics then becomes unreadable to the unauthorized user and is secure. This encrypted statistics may be dispatched over community and may be decrypted by the usage of AES on the receiving end. Hence it guarantees secured transmission of photographs.

The application is a desktop client with it's frontend made using the python module Tkinter(). This provides an interactive window for the user. 
The user will need to provide the location of the image to be encoded or decoded. After this, the user can choose either action of encoding or decoding the image.

It asks for a password, which will basically be the encryption key. After these details are entered, the python functions declared in the program to encode/decode the image using AES.

When this process is done, the user will get encrypted/decrypted image as output which will be saved in the same directory as input image file.
